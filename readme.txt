=======

To run program: 
first run 
python server.py [port], if left to 0 or set to a invalid port it will randomize a valid port.
this will print out the IP and port 
(we have hard coded the ip to local and the port to 9999 for testing)
Next begin the client.py ($ python client.py 127.0.0.1 [port])
once the server and the client connect the game will begin (a curses screen will open and display images).

Game play mechanics:
One player will control the vertical axis and the other player will control the horizontal axis of movement.
(for testing purposes we will only have one client connecting who will control both horizontal and vertical movement)
The player must navigate around obstacles and move to the exit of the screen to progress through the levels.

Controls:
players direct movement using wasd or arrow keys to move,  q or esc key to quit.

Networking:
Accepts: strings of user input and passes them to the server as either strings (for messages) or constants (for directions)
Returns: JSON formated files containing information about player location and graphics.
